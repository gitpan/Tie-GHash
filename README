NAME
    Tie::GHash - A smaller hash

SYNOPSIS
      tie my %words, 'Tie::GHash';
      my $i;
      foreach (@words) {
        $words{$_} = $i++;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface to the Gnome glib library's hashes,
    which are smaller (although possibly slower) than Perl's internal
    hashes.

    Typically, Perl sacrifices memory for speed, and this is the case with
    its built-in hashes. Occasionally, you have a need for a large in-memory
    hash, where it would be useful to sacrifice speed for low memory usage.
    This module provides that functionality.

    Using "Tie::GHash" is very simple: just use the hash in exactly the same
    way as you would use a normal Perl hash, with the exception that you
    need to "tie" it before use as in the synopsis.

    For example, reading in a typical /usr/share/dict/words using Perl's
    built in hashes took up 8,672K. Doing the same with Tie::GHash took up
    7,212K, albeit about six times slower due to the tie interface.

NOTES
    This module requires a recent version of the Inline library. This module
    was created during Brian Ingerson's Inline talk at YAPC::NorthAmerica
    2001 when he asked me to code something fun using Inline, so blame him.
